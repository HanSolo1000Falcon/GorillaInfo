YOU KNOW, GORILLA TAG. A GAME MANY HOLD CLOSE TO HEART.
SO SAD IT HAD TO GO THIS WAY, LEMMING PROBABLY MADE BANK.
BUT REALLY, HE LEFT US WITH THIS SLOP GAME THAT ONLY 3 YEAR OLDS PLAY.
WHY NOT REVISIT IT, MAKE IT INDIE AGAIN!!!
NEW GORILLA TAG, SURE IT HAS A LOT OF FEATURES BUT...
A GAME ABOUT RUNNING ON YOUR HANDS IN VR SHOULDNT HAVE FOOTBALL.
WISH LEMMING WOULD REMOVE ALL THE SLOP (OR ANYONE FOR THAT MATTER)
